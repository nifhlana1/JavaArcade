# JavaArcade
In this project, I coded two games in an Arcade in order to practice Object Oriented design patterns in Java. The project has an arcade class that 'runs' the show. It begins with a menu that asks the user to choose a game - rock paper scissors or a number guessing. Afterwards, the user can choose to play against the computer or alone. 


See file 'UML diagram and overview of concepts used' for a full description and scope of project.
